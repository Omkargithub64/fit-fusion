`Virtual Try-On and Intelligent Wardrobe Management Solution`

## ðŸ“œ Introduction

The simple act of Selecting outfits involves decisions on occasion, color matching, and weather. For most of us, the process can become stressful, especially when time is limited. Repeating outfits or being unsure reduces confidence and adds to decision fatigue. The proposed solution is an app that offers personalized outfit suggestions, tracks worn outfits, and enables a virtual try-on experience, providing both a functional and fun approach to their outfit and wardrobe management.

We will be developing an app that aims to provide users with personalized and aesthetically appealing outfit combinations from their own wardrobe. By leveraging machine learning and image processing, the app generates suitable combinations of tops, bottoms, and shoes based on the userâ€™s preferences, weather conditions, and occasion. Additionally, the app includes a virtual try-on feature that enables users to see how the recommended outfits would look on them by overlaying clothes on their selfies. This system enhances the user's daily decision-making process, making it easier and faster to choose outfits, while also offering a fun and engaging experience through gamified features.
